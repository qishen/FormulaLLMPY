1. Understand the C code in untar1.c, formula.pdf and ParserDSL.4ml. 
2. Model untar1.c in FORMULA by extending the `GenericDataParser` domain in ParserDSL.4ml. 
3. Do not change the type definition in `GenericDataParser` domain such as Status and IntermediateResult.
4. Use strJoin() in FORMULA to concatenate strings.
5. Model `skipEntry` as IntermediateResult in FORMULA and reflect how its value affects the parsing.
6. Model how `skipEntry` is computed from other IntermediateResults or the current read.
